## 🎯 Developer Guidelines for Each Phase

### Starting Work on a Phase

1. **Review the task list** for your assigned phase
2. **Create a feature branch** for your work: `git checkout -b feature/phase-x-task-name`
3. **Set up local environment** with required dependencies
4. **Review existing code** to understand patterns and conventions
5. **Implement tests first** (TDD approach recommended)

### Development Standards

- Follow Laravel conventions and best practices
- Write tests for all new features (unit, feature, and browser tests)
- Use proper error handling and validation
- Document complex business logic
- Ensure responsive design for all user interfaces
- Optimize database queries to prevent N+1 problems

### Code Review Process

1. **Self-review** your code before submitting PR
2. **Ensure all tests pass**: `php artisan test`
3. **Format code**: `vendor/bin/pint`
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Submit PR** with clear description of changes
6. **Address feedback** promptly

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: For business logic and model methods
- **Feature Tests**: For user workflows and API endpoints
- **Browser Tests**: For critical user journeys
- **Performance Tests**: For database-intensive operations
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% for all new code
